### Objective

> Students will learn the Markdown language, understand its syntax, and apply it effectively for note-taking and writing API/application documentation.

## What is Markdown? {#what}
> Markdown is a lightweight markup language that allows you to write using an easy-to-read, easy-to-write plain text format. It can easily be converted into structurally valid HTML (or other formats). The syntax is designed to be simple and intuitive, aiming to make the writing as readable as possible in its raw state.

## What does it do?

- **Format text**: You can apply formatting elements such as headers, bold, italics, bullet lists, and more with simple symbols.
- **Add links and images**: Quickly embed hyperlinks and images into your text using a straightforward syntax.
- **Create tables and code blocks**: Organize information neatly in tables and share code snippets with appropriate formatting.
- **Convert to HTML**: Markdown can be easily converted into HTML, making it suitable for publishing on the web without knowing extensive HTML.

## Why use it?

- **Simplicity**: Markdown's syntax is very straightforward, making it easy to learn and use, even for people who are new to programming or writing for the web.
- **Documentation**: Allows for easy formatting of text, making it more readable and maintainable, while seamlessly integrating with version control systems and supporting conversion to multiple output formats.
- **Efficiency**: It allows writers to format their text without taking their hands off the keyboard, speeding up the writing and editing process.
- **Versatility**: Besides web content, Markdown is excellent for writing documentation, note-taking, and even books, thanks to its readability and ease of use.
- **Integration**: Many tools and platforms (like GitHub, Reddit, and Discord) support Markdown, making it a valuable skill for software development and collaboration.
